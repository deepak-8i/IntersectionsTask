# Intersections Task

Intersections task

There are several segments, each segment has start point (Xs) and end point (Xe). Assume all segments are only on the X plane (i.e. only X values, no other axis).

If Iâ€™d draw it (only for illustration purposes), it will look something like that:



What the code needs to do is to find the first X point where maximum number of the segments are intersecting and indicate how many segments are intersecting in that point (the red vertical line above illustrates where this point is, given the example above).
